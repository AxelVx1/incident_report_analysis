| Summary   | The organization experienced a security incident today when network services suddenly stopped responding. The event caused normal internal network traffic to come to a stop since no network resources could be accessed. The security team found it to be caused by a type of distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). This type of attack is called an ICMP flood attack which is evident by the flood of ICMP packets found by the team. The incident management team responded by blocking any more ICMP packets and stopping all non-critical network services to restore the critical network services.   |
